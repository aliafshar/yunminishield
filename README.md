Yun Mini Shield
--

This is a smaller shield footprint for the Arduino Yun. Normal shields don't
fint on the Yun too well because of the locaition of the ethernet and USB host
ports. It's also almost impossible to get a board that can plug into to SDA/SCL.
But that's OK, because on the Yun, SDA/SCL are also on D2/D3.

This is presented as an Eagle library.

p.s. If you are using it, let me know. I love cool boards.
